A vast fraction of the population of India considers agriculture as its primary occupation. The
production of crops plays an important role in our country. However, still, people face difficulty
in finding useful information or knowledge from those data. Bad quality crop production is
often due to either excessive use of fertilizer or using not enough fertilizer. Recommendation
of crops for land-based on quality and requirement of minerals is called crop recommendation
system. Crop Recommendation System helps farmers by providing useful content to the farmer
based on farmer’s soil quality, it’s pH level, humidity, temperatures, rainfall conditions. The
dataset contains various parameters like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), PH
value of soil, Humidity, Temperature, and Rainfall. This proposed system applied different
kinds of Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random
Forest (RF) etc...The Random Forest algorithm gave the highest accuracy.The proposed system has very less
accuracy and many statistical analysis were not performed. Our proposed system is provided
by doing exploratory analysis and giving maximum accuracy in random forest algorithm.
